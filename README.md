The goal of this exercise was to implement 4 different dynamic sets of our own choice. I chose the following ones:

- AVL tree
- Splay tree
- Hash table with open addressing
- Hash table with chaining

The project also contains a generic testing program (inside Main.java) which can be used to compare individual implementations based on their speed of the insert, search and delete functionalities.
